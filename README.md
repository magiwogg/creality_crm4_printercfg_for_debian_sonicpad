## Creality CR-M4 printer.cfg for Debian Sonicpad
I used this repository with Jpe230's version of Sonic Pad Debian.
https://github.com/Jpe230/SonicPad-Debian

This is slightly modified version from original CR-M4's cfg file for Sonic Pad, like pin output.
You should mention that I have swapped the hotend to Triangle Lab CHCB-OT, snd modded the extruder max_power to 0.5 to prevent dropping power error which frequently happened in my environment. You should adjust it if you are using stock / different hotend, but it makes print a lot better. no underextrusion!
works fine till now, probably works with another variants
